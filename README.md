# Cloud Resume Challenge with AWS

Welcome to my Cloud Resume Challenge project, where I've utilized Amazon Web Services (AWS) to create a dynamic and scalable web-based resume.

## Key Features

1. **Static Website Hosting with Amazon S3:**
   - Hosted the static content of the resume using Amazon S3, providing a secure and scalable storage solution.

2. **Content Delivery with Amazon CloudFront:**
   - Integrated Amazon CloudFront to ensure fast and low-latency content delivery through a global network of edge locations.

3. **Serverless Architecture with AWS Lambda:**
   - Implemented serverless functions using AWS Lambda to handle dynamic content like contact form submissions without managing servers.

4. **DynamoDB for Data Storage:**
   - Used Amazon DynamoDB, a NoSQL database, to efficiently store and manage dynamic data such as contact form submissions.

5. **Identity and Access Management (IAM):**
   - Configured IAM roles and policies to control access securely, following the principle of least privilege.

6. **Continuous Deployment with AWS CodePipeline:**
   - Set up AWS CodePipeline for continuous integration and deployment, ensuring seamless updates to the resume website.
